# Blood_Bank_Database

Blood Bank management system project for a '02170 Database Systems' course. In  this  project,  we  have modeled  a  blood  bank  database  system  that  will primarily be used by hospitals and their staff.  The blood bank system consists of several hospitals each having a unique hospital ID, an address and a name.Each  hospital  also  includes  some  staff  members,  patients,  donors  and  blood donations.
